# hello-world
Hi there, my name is chen sirui.
I was strong-willed, but I don't why I begun to losing control of myself. 
  -Playing PC games: WOT(for 2.5 years), Witcher,GTA5,Gwentcards,Biohazard2,etc
  -Watching live streaming of WOT(Sleep late)
  -Water Gel Blaster, since April, spent a lot
  -Jerking off almost everyday
  -sleep over time, always hang up in the middle of work
I was fit, but now I'm always anxious (work delay), not likely in the mood of workout.
Please give me power, to a confessed soul.
